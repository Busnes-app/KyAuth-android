# KyAuth Android Client

KyAuth is the native Android authenticator for the KySecurity suite.

## Purpose

KyAuth pairs an Android device with KySignOn. It stores TOTP entries in an encrypted local KDBX v4 vault. It also provides a local biometric and optional PIN lock.

## Current product contract

- Pairing accepts a short-lived KySignOn QR payload or manual server details.
- Release builds require HTTPS. Debug builds permit loopback HTTP only.
- The optional registration URL must use the same origin as the pairing server.
- The app generates a hardware-backed P-256 device signing key.
- TOTP entries use KeePass `TimeOtp-*` fields in `totp_vault.kdbx`, along with standard KeePass title, URL, and notes.
- The TOTP vault uses an app-private file and an independent random vault key.
- Both vault keys are wrapped by `VaultKek`, an authentication-bound Keystore RSA-OAEP key
  (`setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`, per-use). Wrapping needs no prompt; unwrapping requires a
  `BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject`. A device without a secure lock screen cannot use KyAuth.
- One authentication yields one unwrap, so both keys share a single wrapped blob.
- The app locks when it moves to the background. It clears in-memory TOTP data and its copied code,
  and zeroes the vault key arrays.
- The PIN is an optional second local factor. Failed PIN attempts use delays of 0, 5, 30, and 300 seconds. The fifth failure wipes local data.
- Release builds disable screenshots and Android backup.
- Push MFA receives KySignOn FCM data-message challenges, posts a local notification, and opens the Push MFA tab for approve/deny. A response is only ever sent to the paired server; a `serverUrl` in the push payload is ignored. Digits must be two-digit, decoys are capped at 3, and expiry is clamped to 10 minutes.
- An MFA response must carry an explicit decision. A 2xx with no `approved`/`success` field is a protocol error, not an approval.
- The KyPasswords key envelope must declare `kdf: argon2id`, and derivation uses the envelope's own
  `memoryKiB`/`iterations`/`parallelism` (Argon2id v1.3). Any other value, including a missing
  field, is refused rather than guessed at: the superseded PBKDF2 shape marked itself by omitting
  `kdf`, and with no KyPasswords deployment holding one, no envelope of that shape exists to read.
  Costs are server-supplied, so they are range-checked before anything is allocated (256 MiB
  ceiling) and rejected, not clamped. KyAuth writes the OWASP baseline (64 MiB, t=3, p=1).
- KDBX entry fields use the KeePass wire names from kotpass's `BasicField.key`, not the enum
  constant `name`. The two differ only for the URL field (`URL` vs `Url`); KyAuth used the constant,
  so its URLs were invisible to KeePassXC, KeePassDX and the KyPasswords web client, and theirs to
  KyAuth. Proven by `kypasswords-web-vault.kdbx`, a fixture written by kdbxweb.
- Passwords and Passkeys use `passwords_vault.kdbx`. The app can generate an independent random local vault key for device-only storage. Pairing with an empty KyPasswords account uploads that local vault with a client-created password envelope; pairing never replaces an existing server vault that uses another key.
- A passkey whose RP ID is the paired KySignOn server's host is the exception: its private key is
  generated in AndroidKeyStore (StrongBox where available, TEE otherwise), is non-exportable, and
  never enters a KDBX vault or any synced artifact. Only its metadata is stored, in
  `SignOnPasskeyStore`. The assertion path never calls `AppLockManager.useVaultKeys`, so KySignOn
  MFA keeps working while the password vault is locked, compromised, or in recovery. The Credential
  Provider therefore offers this one entry while KyAuth is locked, alongside the unlock action.
  Losing the device means falling back to KySignOn recovery codes or an admin MFA reset.
- Passkeys use native ES256 / P-256 WebAuthn cryptography with COSE public key encoding and ECDSA assertion signing.
- KyAuth acts as an Android 14+ (API 34+) system Credential Provider for both Passkeys and Passwords via `KyAuthCredentialProviderService` (with `CredentialAuthActivity`) and an Android 12+ (API 31+) system Autofill Service via `KyAuthAutofillService`.
- While locked, neither provider touches vault material. Autofill returns a `FillResponse` with an
  authentication `IntentSender` (`AutofillUnlockActivity`). The Credential Provider returns an
  authentication `Action` (`CredentialUnlockActivity`) for anything vault-backed, and, when a
  KySignOn passkey is enrolled, a real credential entry for it directly alongside that action — the
  passkey entry needs no vault key, which is why it can be offered while locked. The vault-backed
  paths unwrap the keys for one operation via `AppLockManager.useVaultKeys` and erase them again, so
  a background request never unlocks the app.
- Passkey RP IDs are validated by `RpId`: syntactically valid, not a public suffix, and for browser
  callers equal to or a registrable parent of the caller's web origin. Native-app callers are bound
  to the RP by `DigitalAssetLinks`, which fetches `https://<rpId>/.well-known/assetlinks.json` and
  matches the caller's signing certificate. It fails closed: no statement, or an offline device with
  a cold cache, means no passkeys are offered to a native caller.
- A caller-supplied `clientDataHash` is honoured only from a caller that set a privileged web origin
  (`ClientData.privilegedClientDataHash`). Only a holder of `CREDENTIAL_MANAGER_SET_ORIGIN` can set
  that origin, so an ordinary app cannot choose the bytes KyAuth signs. For every other caller the
  `CollectedClientData` is built here, with the `android:apk-key-hash:` origin.
- Autofill believes a request's `webDomain` only from a known browser installed as a system app or
  by Google Play; any other
  caller is matched on its own package. `setWebDomain` is public API, so an unfiltered domain from an
  arbitrary app would hand one site's credential to another.
- Password fill matches an entry's domain or its subdomains, never a parent or sibling, and never
  across a public suffix. Passkey matching is exact on RP ID.
- Incremental password/passkey edits use `KdbxPasswordVault.update`; delete uses its serialized
  `delete` operation. Both mutate the decoded KDBX by UUID, retaining groups, unknown fields,
  attachments, history and metadata. `saveEntries` only creates a new file. Existing empty or
  unreadable files fail closed. Live reads exclude the metadata-identified recycle bin and its
  descendants. Disabled recycling requires explicit permanent-delete confirmation. User edits
  honor the file's history item/content-size budgets; signCount-only updates add no history.
  Password vault reads and mutations run on worker threads; only their results reach the UI.
- `KyPasswordVaultSync` serializes sync sessions and uploads immutable encrypted snapshots.
  Downloads are decoded before installation under the local vault monitor. A remote replacement
  requires an unchanged local file and a known clean sync fingerprint. Unknown or dirty state,
  concurrent local writes and HTTP 409 preserve encrypted versions in `password-vault-conflicts`
  and surface a conflict; they never merge UI projections or automatically overwrite either side.
  Byte-identical local/remote files establish a missing baseline on upgrade. Explicit resolution
  chooses the whole device or server vault, guarded by If-Match and local-change detection.
  Clean successful syncs and unpairing remove conflict copies; startup/sync sweeps interrupted
  snapshots. Unpair clears the account, key and files in one vault transaction, so a new local
  vault cannot overtake teardown. A validated master-password key is adopted before sync, so network errors leave
  local access and conflict resolution available.
  Passwords can export those files; revealing their opening key uses the existing authenticated offline-key flow. Local wipe
  removes the conflict files along with all app-private files.
- The Passwords tab supports pairing with KyPasswords, syncing vaults, local add, generate, list, reveal, copy, and delete actions with distinct Passkey badging. Reveal and copy require a biometric or device-authentication prompt.
- The Passwords Recycle Bin is a metadata-only deleted-entry view, including descendants and
  untitled/non-password records. Restore moves the intact original entry to the live root; it
  preserves the UUID and all contents. There is no purge action. App lock clears and dismisses
  open dialogs, including unsaved forms and revealed secrets.
- Reused passwords compares exact nonempty strings across all live KDBX records, including
  whitespace-only passwords and untitled records. Its results contain metadata and counts only;
  passwords are never logged or sent. Open recovery/reuse views refresh after vault reloads.
- Foreground idle locking defaults to five minutes, configurable to 1/5/15/30/60 minutes in
  Settings. It uses elapsed realtime, includes dialog activity, and checks expiry before accepting
  new input. Background locking remains immediate. Lock generations reject stale asynchronous
  unlock/reveal results; only the UI thread installs loaded entry lists.
- Copied passwords are marked sensitive and clear after 30 seconds or when KyAuth locks.

## UI contract

- Use the `KyAuth` name in user-visible text.
- Keep the KyAuth Systems stamp shield and KyAuth wordmark in the header and lock screen.
- Use the five-part bottom pill: TOTP Vault, Push MFA, lock shield, Passwords, Settings.
- The TOTP Vault screen provides a + icon to scan QR or add accounts manually with optional Website and Notes fields.
- Use the 15 suite themes from `ThemeManager`. The default is Patina Ky.
- Use rounded, flat buttons. Do not add elevation shadows to custom controls.

## Project layout

- `app/src/main/java/org/kysecurity/authenticator/MainActivity.kt`: app UI and workflows.
- `pairing/`: QR parsing, endpoint validation, pairing network client, device key, and encrypted pairing store.
- `mfa/`: push challenge model, FCM receive service, signed payload, and response client.
- `security/`: lock state, PIN policy, `VaultKek` authentication-bound key wrapping, `VaultUnlockPrompt`, atomic file writes, and local wipe.
- `totp/`: TOTP parsing, generation, and KDBX persistence.
- `passwords/`: password/passkey entry models, domain matcher, password generator, autofill service, and KDBX persistence.
- `passkeys/`: FIDO2 WebAuthn crypto engine, `ClientData` (CollectedClientData), `RpId` validation,
  `SignOnPasskey` routing plus its hardware key and metadata store, CredentialProviderService, entry
  builder, slice builder, unlock activity, and auth activity.
- `ThemeManager.kt`: the shared 15-theme palette and local theme preference.
- `UiComponents.kt`: reusable programmatic view styling and controls.
- `AboutDialog.kt`: MIT About dialog.

## Work guidance

- Use the smallest correct change.
- Reuse native Android APIs and existing project code before adding dependencies.
- Fix shared root causes, not one call site.
- Keep security checks fail-closed.
- Add a focused test for non-trivial logic.
- Update this file when a durable product contract, workflow, or file boundary changes.

## Verification

Run unit tests, lint, the debug build, and compile device tests:

```bash
./gradlew test lintDebug assembleDebug compileDebugAndroidTestSources
npm ci --prefix tools --ignore-scripts
pip install argon2-cffi==25.1.0
node tools/vault_preservation.js app/build/interop
```

`KdbxPreservationTest` writes the Android round-trip outputs consumed by the Node verifier.
Regenerate the fake-secret rich fixtures with `node tools/vault_preservation.js generate`.

## Outstanding security work

Recorded so it is not mistaken for done:

- **Non-Play browser builds.** `TrustedBrowsers` accepts known browser packages only when installed
  by Google Play or as system apps. F-Droid and direct-download builds fail closed until explicit
  signing-certificate pins are maintained for them.
- **Vault size ceilings.** `KyPasswordClient` and `KdbxPasswordVault` cap a synced vault at 25 MB and
  a JSON body at 1 MB. Large legitimate vaults would need these raised.
- **Push MFA payload binding.** `MfaMessage.formatPayload` still signs only
  `prefix|challengeId|verb|digits`. Binding server origin, account, purpose and expiry needs a
  matching KySignOn server change.
- **Non-KySignOn passkey private keys are exportable.** Deliberate: they live in the KDBX vault so
  they sync and restore, as other password managers do. Protection comes from the
  authentication-bound vault key. The KySignOn login passkey is the exception and is
  hardware-resident; see the product contract above.
- **KySignOn passkey attestation.** Even when the key is hardware-backed, `fmt` is still `none`, so
  the server has only the client's word for it. `setAttestationChallenge` plus a verifier in
  `kysignon-server` would make it evidence.
- **KySignOn passkey hardware backing is unverified.** `SignOnPasskeyKey.generate` accepts a key
  only when `KeyInfo.securityLevel` is `TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT`, `STRONGBOX` or `UNKNOWN_SECURE`, so
  both `SOFTWARE` and `UNKNOWN` ("the platform could not tell") are refused; the fail-closed path
  is covered by a passing instrumented test. The positive path is not: every available Android
  emulator ships the software KeyMint reference implementation, so `generate` returning a
  hardware-backed key has never been observed succeeding. Four instrumented tests in
  `SignOnPasskeyKeyTest` are gated behind a JUnit assumption and SKIP rather than pass. Running
  them on a physical device is what closes this; until then, do not claim the key is
  hardware-resident.
- **Credential picker accumulation is unverified.** While locked, the provider returns the KySignOn
  entry alongside the unlock action, and `CredentialUnlockActivity` deliberately passes
  `signOnPasskey = null` so the entry is not duplicated after unlocking. That is correct only if the
  framework ADDS an authentication action's entries to those already shown rather than replacing
  them. This was decided by reading AOSP, not by observation. Verify on a device: with KyAuth locked,
  trigger a KySignOn sign-in, tap "Unlock KyAuth", and confirm the KySignOn passkey is still offered.
  If it disappears, pass the record through in `CredentialUnlockActivity` instead of null.
- **Device verification.** Emulator tests cover secure-lock-backed `VaultKek` creation and backup
  flags. Full biometric prompts, `useVaultKeys`, provider unlock flows, and the per-use
  `BiometricPrompt` for the KySignOn passkey (enrolment and assertion, via
  `VaultUnlockPrompt.showForSignature`) still require manual device verification; none of these are
  currently automated here.
- **Deprecated platform APIs.** `Slice`, `EncryptedSharedPreferences`/`MasterKey`, and the
  `Dataset`/`FillResponse` builders are deprecated. Moving to `androidx.credentials` would remove
  most of the Slice usage.
